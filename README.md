## About 

What is truly unique about this application is the unique ranking system called the Overall Tennis Score (OTS) system. The OTS score is out of 16 points and is similar to the UTR score used by Universal Tennis to rate the competitive level of a tennis player.


The OTS score is calculated on two aspects: the base score and the running score. The base score is calculated when a player answers a survey about their history with the game, such as the player ºs age, how long they have been playing tennis, whether they held a starting position on their high school team, how many tournaments they have won, etc. The link to the survey is here: https://forms.gle/FmNtAmDwJrLYxGsw8 


After filling out the survey, a players base OTS score will be calculated based around a formula


The Base OTS score is divided into two fractions, the left and the right one which are both weighted differently, meaning that they are divided by different numbers. This is because each tennis player has both skill level and experience which contribute to their level as a player.

## The App

This application is used to calculate the OTS scores of two players after a match has completed, view the leaderboard, and update each player's individual OTS score.

## Usage

Since this is an iOS application, XCode IDE is preferred. Upon opening the folder in XCode, you would just need to attach a physical device or a virtual one through a simulator and run it on XCode itself.
